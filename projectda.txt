As the process of analyzing raw data to find trends and answer questions, the definition of data analytics captures its broad scope of the field.
However, it includes many techniques with many different goals.
The data analytics process has some components that can help a variety of initiatives.
By combining these components, a successful data analytics initiative will provide a clear picture of where you are, where you have been and where you should go.
Generally, this process begins with descriptive analytics.
This is the process of describing historical trends in data. 
Descriptive analytics aims to answer the question “what happened?” This often involves measuring traditional indicators such as return on investment (ROI). 
The indicators used will be different for each industry. 
Descriptive analytics does not make predictions or directly inform decisions. 
It focuses on summarizing data in a meaningful and descriptive way.
The next essential part of data analytics is advanced analytics. 
This part of data science takes advantage of advanced tools to extract data, make predictions and discover trends. 
These tools include classical statistics as well as machine learning. 
Machine learning technologies such as neural networks, natural language processing, sentiment analysis and more enable advanced analytics. 
This information provides new insight from data. 
Advanced analytics addresses “what if?” questions.
The availability of machine learning techniques, massive data sets, and cheap computing power has enabled the use of these techniques in many industries. 
The collection of big data sets is instrumental in enabling these techniques. 
Big data analytics enables businesses to draw meaningful conclusions from complex and varied data sources, which has been made possible by advances in parallel processing and cheap computational power.
